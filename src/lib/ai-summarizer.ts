            Your summary should:
            1. Begin with an engaging podcast-style introduction

      Welcome to The Crux, where we distill essential information into bite-sized audio. I'm your host, and today we're exploring web accessibility.
      
      Web accessibility ensures people with disabilities can use websites effectively. It's not just a moral obligationâ€”it benefits everyone, including older adults, people with temporary disabilities, and those on slow connections.
      
      The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines follow four key principles: making content perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. This includes providing alt text for images, ensuring keyboard navigation works, using clear heading structures, and maintaining sufficient color contrast.
      
      To improve accessibility on your site, start with an audit using tools like WAVE or Lighthouse, address critical issues first, include people with disabilities in testing, and make accessibility part of your development process from day one.
      
      Remember, an accessible website expands your audience and provides a better experience for everyone. This has been The Crux of web accessibility. Thanks for listening!
